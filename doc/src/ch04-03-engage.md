# Engage Crate

The most useful crate for manipulating game data and more. The Engage crate lets us access the game's specific internals through the code itself. We can access XML data in structures, Unit data, Save data and more. More documentation on the crate can be found [here](https://divinedragonfanclub.github.io/engage/engage/index.html).

You can find the crate's source code [here](https://github.com/DivineDragonFanClub/engage).

This utility of this crate is often project specific, so it's implementations are there to reduce the repetition of work needed to be done in code modding. As said before, pull request are appricated.
