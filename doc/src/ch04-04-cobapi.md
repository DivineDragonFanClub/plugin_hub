# CobAPI Crate

This crate gives us the ability to talk to Cobalt, letting us add settings menus through it's systems or be told when specific events occur and let us run code at that time. This crate sees less use in code modding but still provided very useful functionality.

You can find the crate's source code [here](https://github.com/DivineDragonFanClub/cobapi).
